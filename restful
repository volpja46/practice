The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers.
HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.

GET - Requests data from a specified resource
POST - Submits data to be processed to a specified resource
Never use GET when sending passwords or other sensitive information!
get - can be bookmarked post - cannot be bookmarked
GET is less secure compared to POST because data sent is part of the URL
POST is a little safer than GET because the parameters are not stored in browser history or in web server logs

notable
POST requests are never cached
POST requests do not remain in the browser history
POST requests cannot be bookmarked
POST requests have no restrictions on data length

HEAD	Same as GET but returns only HTTP headers and no document body
PUT	Uploads a representation of the specified URI
DELETE	Deletes the specified resource
OPTIONS	Returns the HTTP methods that the server supports
CONNECT	Converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel
