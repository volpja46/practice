The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers.
HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.

GET - Requests data from a specified resource
POST - Submits data to be processed to a specified resource

notable
POST requests are never cached
POST requests do not remain in the browser history
POST requests cannot be bookmarked
POST requests have no restrictions on data length

HEAD	Same as GET but returns only HTTP headers and no document body
PUT	Uploads a representation of the specified URI
DELETE	Deletes the specified resource
OPTIONS	Returns the HTTP methods that the server supports
CONNECT	Converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel
